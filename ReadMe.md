## Overview 📝 ##

Rubicon Movies is a React app that uses TheMovieDB API to display a list of movies and TV shows. You can browse through different categories, search for your favorite titles, and view detailed information about each movie or show. This app was created as a task assigned to me as a part of a job interview process.
